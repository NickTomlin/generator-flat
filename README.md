# generator-flat

My browserify/stylus/nobullshit boilerplate. I use this to scratch out ideas when JSBIN is not a good fit (which is rare).

```
# if yeoman is not installed, install him via ``npm install -g yo``
$ npm install -g generator-flat
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo flat
```

# TODO
[ ] Templating (hbs anyone?)
[ ] Data store (some built in flat json or api hookups)
[ ] Default to everything (then go through the picklist if "no" is selected)
[ ] Provide "plugins" that make swapping out a framework easier. React etc.
